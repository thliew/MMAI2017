MMAI 2017 Fall

## Proposed Idea:
1. Painting Style Classification
	- Motivation:
	There are many sources and forms of images with different painting style due to color, texture, emotion, content, etc. Thus, we hope that given a input data, the system is able to classified the input into the label we have in database. 

	- Target input:
		- Comic: Comic from Japan, America, China and Taiwan have the own style. For instance, human can easily differentiate Marvel Comic and Japanese Comic (One piece).
		- Animation
		- Painting

	- Potential problem:
		- Database, including how do we labeling them? How many class do we need? How many classes can we label?
